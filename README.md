This project automates the process of waste segregation using a robotic arm system. It employs computer vision techniques to identify waste types and instructs a robotic arm to pick and place them into appropriate bins, creating an integrated and intelligent sorting system.

## üöÄ Features

- **Vision-Based Waste Identification**: Uses a trained object detection model (`best.pt`) to recognize different waste materials.
- **Robotic Arm Control**: Interfaces with a physical robotic arm to perform pick-and-place operations.
- **Integrated Workflow**: Seamless combination of video input, classification logic, and motor control.
- **Embedded Compatibility**: Can potentially run on platforms like Raspberry Pi (suggested by `rpif.py`).

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

Follow these steps to install and run the system locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/waste-segregation-using-robotic-arm.git
cd waste-segregation-using-robotic-arm
```

### 2. Install Python Dependencies

It‚Äôs recommended to use a virtual environment.

```bash
# Optional virtual environment
# python -m venv venv
# source venv/bin/activate     # For Linux/macOS
# venv\Scripts\activate        # For Windows

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Build C++ Components

Navigate to the `RoboticArm` folder (if applicable) and compile using your preferred toolchain:

```bash
cd RoboticArm
# Example (adjust per platform):
# make
# OR
# cmake .
# make
```

### 4. Model Setup

Ensure the `best.pt` model file is placed in the project root directory. This file contains the trained weights for waste classification.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

To begin the waste segregation process:

1. **Prepare Hardware**: Set up the robotic arm and camera module.
2. **Run the Main Script**:

```bash
python rpif.py
```

3. **Optional Arguments**:
```bash
# Use a connected webcam
python rpif.py --source 0

# Use a test video file
python rpif.py --source test.mp4
```

> Refer to the internal code of `rpif.py` to understand accepted arguments and expected formats.
